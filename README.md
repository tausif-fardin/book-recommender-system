# Collaborative Book Recommendation System

This repository contains a collaborative book recommendation system that uses machine learning techniques, specifically collaborative filtering, to suggest books to users based on their preferences and behaviors.

## Overview

A recommender system predicts the preferences or ratings a user would give to an item. In this case, it predicts book ratings for users. Three primary recommendation systems are used:

1. **Content Filtering**: Finds items similar to what a user has interacted with.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on similarities between users.
3. **Hybrid Filtering**: Utilizes both content and collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.
